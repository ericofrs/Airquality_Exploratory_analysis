# Airquality_Exploratory_analysis

Final exercise of Module 1 of the R course

## Project summary

The exercise has been divided in 5 parts:

1 - Understanding the dataset

2 - Setting up the R Project and Github Repo

3 - Data cleaning and transformation

4 - Data visualization and Insights

5 - Project documentation on README file

## The Dataset

I worked with the dataset "airquality", which is already available in the base R package "datasets".

The dataset contains 153 observations and 6 variables. After analyzing it, we notice the existence of NA values (those rows have been later deleted).

## Findings

A more detailed analysis can be found in the file <url of RMarkdown file>.

## How to use it

Feel free to fork this repository and do your own exploratory analysis as well.
